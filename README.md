# Mecanum Buggy - Andechser 1

---
## Motivation

The beginnig was a video on this NVIDIA [web page](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/fraunhofer-research-robotics/) (at around 0:38). 


This web page was about NVIDIA Omniverse, and how one can 
use it to simulate a hardware to accelerate the development. 

But what caught my eyes is the [Mecanum wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel). 

Mecanum wheels enable a vehicle to run sideway straight, while 
looking exactly to front. 

This makes staring irrelevant for a vehicle. One can remove the staring mechanism as a whole. One can also forget about turning radius of a vehicle. 

We only need a corridor in a warehouse that is exactly the same width with the vehicle. 

I first thought how cool Fraunhofer Institute is, but it turns out Mecanum wheel was invented by a Swedish engineer Bengt Erland, and was patented in 1970s ('Mecanum'  is the name of the company). 

I wanted to reproduce a buggy with Mecanum wheels
and would like to see it runs sideway with my own eyes. 
I will use ESP32 to operate the buggy over WiFi.
